# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Vending-Machine-Controller-using-Verilog
The purpose of this project is to design a Vending FSM and then implement it using Verilog. We need to design a vending machine that accepts money input in any sequence and delivers the product when the required price has reached and also returns back the change.
